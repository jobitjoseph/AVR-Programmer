# UPDI HV Programmer - ATmega8/88/168/328 (SMD)

HV UPDI (High Voltage Unified Program and Debug Interface) programmer for the new tinyAVR 0- and 1-series microcontrollers built on ATmega8/88/168/328 based on the design and the firmware by Dlloydev (https://github.com/Dlloydev/jtag2updi). The HV UPDI programmer will enable you to use the additional configuration settings for the UPDI pin without the fear of getting locked out from the MCU. It features 3 programming modes: UPDI, HV or PCHV, with the target voltage at 5V.

**Mode Jumper Settings:**

|Mode Jumper|Prog Mode|PA0 Configurations|HV Pulse|Power Cycle|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|no jumper|UPDI|UPDI|NO|NO|
|pins 2-3 shorted|HV|UPDI, RESET|YES|NO|
|pins 1-2 shorted|PCHV|UPDI, RESET, GPIO|YES|YES|

**Modes:**

|Mode|Function|
|-|-|
|UPDI Mode|This mode would be used when the UPDI pin is configured as UPDI or for any target device that isn't HV tolerant.|
|HV Mode|This mode applies the 12V UPDI enable sequence (HV pulse) at the start of the programming sequence. This temporarily reconfigures the UPDI/Reset pin to UPDI mode which will remain in this state until the next power on reset (POR). This allows programming to occur when the pin is configured as Reset. A POR needs to occur for any fuse setting changes to take effect.|
|PCHV Mode|Power Cycle High Voltage mode (PCHV) will initiate a power cycle and HV pulse at the start of the programming sequence. At the end of the sequence, a second power cycle will occur which causes any new fuse setting to take effect. The power cycle OFF duration has been set to 10ms. This mode would be used when the UPDI/Reset pin is configured as Reset or as GPIO.|

**Status LED Operation:**

|LED|Status|
|-|-|
|PWR|STEADY ON when programmer is powered|
|PRG|STEADY ON when in programming mode; BLINKING at 4Hz if target overload occurs|
|HV|FLASHING at HV pulses during programming|

# UPDI HV Programmer Mini - ATtiny1604/1614 (SMD)

Mini HV UPDI (High Voltage Unified Program and Debug Interface) programmer for the new tinyAVR 0- and 1-series microcontrollers built on ATtiny1604/1614 based on the design and the firmware by Dlloydev (https://github.com/Dlloydev/jtag2updi). The Mini HV UPDI programmer will enable you to use the additional configuration settings for the UPDI pin without the fear of getting locked out from the MCU. It features 3 programming modes: UPDI, HV or PCHV, with the target voltage at 5V.

**SELFPRG Jumper Settings:**

|SELFPRG Jumper|Prog Mode|
|-|-|
|no jumper|Normal operation.|
|pins 1-2 shorted|UPDI - Uploading firmware or installing bootloader via UPDI header using another UPDI (HV) programmer. This is necessary when no bootloader is installed.|
|pins 2-3 shorted|USB - Uploading firmware via USB. An installed bootloader is required.|

**MODE Jumper Settings:**

|MODE Jumper|Prog Mode|PA0 Configurations|HV Pulse|Power Cycle|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|no jumper|UPDI|UPDI|NO|NO|
|pins 2-3 shorted|HV|UPDI, RESET|YES|NO|
|pins 1-2 shorted|PCHV|UPDI, RESET, GPIO|YES|YES|

# USBasp - ATmega8A (SMD)

USBasp - USB ISP/TPI programmer stick for Atmel AVR microcontrollers with 5V and 3.3V target voltage based on the design by Thomas Fischl. More information can be found at https://www.fischl.de/usbasp/. Windows users may need to install a driver. Of course this is not necessary for linux and mac users.

|Jumper|Function|
|-|-|
|TGTVCC|Close to power target device via ISP header|
|SELFPRG|Close to upload firmware to USBasp itself via ISP header|
|SLOWCLK|Close to upload firmware to target device with slow speed (necessary for factory-new microcontrollers)|
