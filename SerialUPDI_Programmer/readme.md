# SerialUPDI Programmer
Simple UPDI programmer for tinyAVR, megaAVR and AVR-Dx microcontrollers with voltage selection switch (5V and 3.3V). The programmer works with [pyupdi](https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi) as well as with the Arduino IDE as ["SerialUPDI with 4.7k resistor or diode"](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore). It is based on the USB-to-serial chip [CH340N](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2101130932_WCH-Jiangsu-Qin-Heng-CH340N_C506813.pdf).
